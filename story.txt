Andrew always started his mornings with a strong cup of coffee and a walk through the park. The locals had grown used to seeing Andrew at the same bench by the pond, where he’d sit with a worn notebook and a thoughtful expression.
One morning, Andrew noticed a small dog without a collar following him. "Well, hello there," Andrew said, crouching down. The dog wagged its tail and barked softly. Andrew laughed and decided to call the little guy "Lucky."
That week, Andrew returned every day to the park with treats in his pocket. Lucky was always there, waiting. On the fourth day, a boy named Leo approached him and said, “You’re the one Andrew, right? The guy who reads by the pond?”
“That's me,” Andrew replied with a smile.
Leo explained that Lucky had been a stray in the neighbourhood for weeks. Andrew and Leo teamed up to look after the dog, posting flyers and asking around. As the days passed, more people in the park began to recognize Andrew and joined in to help.
Soon, a small group formed—dog walkers, joggers, and even a local vendor—who met up regularly near Andrew’s bench. It became a community of sorts, brought together by a shared effort and a friendly face named Andrew.
Eventually, Lucky found a new home with one of the group members, but the morning meetups continued. People still looked for Andrew by the pond, often stopping to chat or share a story before starting their day.
It wasn’t long before someone jokingly called that corner of the park “Andrew’s spot”—and the name stuck.
