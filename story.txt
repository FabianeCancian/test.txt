Fabiane always started his mornings with a strong cup of coffee and a walk through the park. The locals had grown used to seeing Fabiane at the same bench by the pond, where he’d sit with a worn notebook and a thoughtful expression.
One morning, Fabiane noticed a small dog without a collar following him. "Well, hello there," Fabiane said, crouching down. The dog wagged its tail and barked softly. Fabiane laughed and decided to call the little guy "Lucky."
That week, Fabiane returned every day to the park with treats in his pocket. Lucky was always there, waiting. On the fourth day, a boy named Leo approached him and said, “You’re the one Fabiane, right? The guy who reads by the pond?”
“That's me,” Fabiane replied with a smile.
Leo explained that Lucky had been a stray in the neighbourhood for weeks. Fabiane and Leo teamed up to look after the dog, posting flyers and asking around. As the days passed, more people in the park began to recognize Fabiane and joined in to help.
Soon, a small group formed—dog walkers, joggers, and even a local vendor—who met up regularly near Fabiane’s bench. It became a community of sorts, brought together by a shared effort and a friendly face named Fabiane.
Eventually, Lucky found a new home with one of the group members, but the morning meetups continued. People still looked for Fabiane by the pond, often stopping to chat or share a story before starting their day.
It wasn’t long before someone jokingly called that corner of the park “Fabiane’s spot”—and the name stuck.
